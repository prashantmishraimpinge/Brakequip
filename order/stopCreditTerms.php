<p>We notice your account is on 'Stop Shipment' because your 30-Day account with us has funds outstanding. If you have already brought your account up to date, your order will ship as soon as we see the funds in our bank account or your cheque is received. If you have not sent us funds, we will really appreciate you making a payment to bring your account up to date. Once your payment is received, we will ship your order.
<br /><br />
Thank you for your co-operation.
